     <p className='bio'>I am a Software Engineer currently working with React.js, SQL, Flask, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python. I am keen on developing time and space efficient, smoothly functioning products. As an individual with Data Science, and Design & Art experience, I am driven to building your vision through the use of the best technologies and practices, while having a meaningful relationship, and thought process with the included fields/subject matter.<br /><br />

I started programming in my spare time a little over three years ago with DataCamp learning the fundamentals of programming, and Python, and then later focusing on using Python for Data Science. I found it to be fascinating, thrilling, and challenging. Aside from html, it was my first introduction to communicating and working with the computer without too much of a graphical user interface. The concept was not completely foreign to me, but there were so many things that were brand new. It was exciting for me because I genuinely enjoy tech. I have faced many challenges that I have overcome so far in this journey, and I retain the experiences.<br /><br />

I enrolled in General Assembly's full time Software Engineering Immersive, and was introduced to HTML5, CSS3, Javascript & Javascript frameworks, Node.js, SQL & NOSQL databases, backend technologies such as Express, Mongoose, & Django, and a variety of other web technologies and concepts. Since then I have built numerous projects and familiarized myself with powerful frameworks such as REACT, introduced myself to Typescript, and also use programs like Adobe Illustrator to design as well.</p>
